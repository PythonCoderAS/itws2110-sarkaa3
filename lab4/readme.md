In a world in which information technology affects virtually everything we do, there is a demand for an academic program that offers students the deepest understanding of the Web.  As an ITWS student, you will investigate issues related to security, trust, privacy, content value, and the development of the Web in the future.

You will take a core set of courses on Web and IT development and management, along with courses in your focus track, selected from more than 20 options, including arts, engineering, management, communications, artificial intelligence, Web systems, and medicine.

 

Curriculum
Completion of the B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science requires a total of 128 - 130 credit hours:

ITWS Core Requirements (24 - 26 credits)
The ITWS core requirements establish a solid foundation for applying ITWS to any discipline.

Focus Track Requirement (44 credits)
The required focus track provides an opportunity for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Focus track options include arts, communication and networks, law, management information systems, medicine, psychology, and numerous others. In consultation with a faculty adviser, students may also design their own focus track through the selection of courses that match their individual interests.

Summer Here
During The Arch, students remain on campus for the summer after their sophomore year, taking junior-level classes, and receive focused attention from professors at this pivotal point in their academic progression. 

The World Away
Then, students leave the Troy campus for a semester during the traditional junior year—either fall or spring—to pursue their passions in the form of co-ops, internships, civic engagement, research, or international experiences. Students who pursue these opportunities during their academic career are better prepared for future professional careers and graduate school.
