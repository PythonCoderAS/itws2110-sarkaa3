give me the html css and javascript for a website about Rensselear Polytechnic Institute's ITWS program

make the colors of that website similar to the official Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute website

generate the html for all of the pages

fill in the header and footer for those HTML files

Add an image to the head of the site names ITWS_header.png

Why is the image not working 

Make the image the whole background header

add the rest of my html back and add the css in a seperate file

fill in the rest of my html leave none out

there is an extra copy of the image in the header, remove it
