        <h3>Curriculum</h3>

        <p><em>Completion of the <strong>B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science</strong> requires a total of <strong>128 - 130 credit hours</strong>:</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>ITWS Core Requirements (24 - 26 credits)</strong>: The ITWS core requirements establish a solid foundation for applying ITWS to any discipline.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Focus Track Requirement (44 credits)</strong></em>: The required focus track provides an opportunity for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Focus track options include arts, communication and networks, law, management information systems, medicine, psychology, and numerous others. In consultation with a faculty adviser, students may also design their own focus track through the selection of courses that match their individual interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Rensselaer Degree Requirements (60 credits)</strong>: The Rensselaer requirements ensure the degree’s breadth and its consistency with long-established Rensselaer traditions.</li>

                    <h4>Arch</h4>
                    <p>The Arch is a unique approach to education that provides flexibility in the semester schedule, allowing students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century. The Arch is a requirement of the Rensselaer curriculum.</p>
                    <p><strong>Summer Here</strong><br>During The Arch, students remain on campus for the summer after their sophomore year, taking junior-level classes, and receive focused attention from professors at this pivotal point in their academic progression.</p>
                    <p><strong>The World Away</strong><br>Then, students leave the Troy campus for a semester during the traditional junior year—either fall or spring—to pursue their passions in the form of co-ops, internships, civic engagement, research, or international experiences. Students who pursue these opportunities during their academic career are better prepared for future professional careers and graduate school.</p>
