                    <h4>Arch</h4>
                    <p>The Arch is a unique approach to education that provides flexibility in the semester schedule, allowing students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century. The Arch is a requirement of the Rensselaer curriculum.</p>
                    <p><strong>Summer Here</strong><br>During The Arch, students remain on campus for the summer after their sophomore year, taking junior-level classes, and receive focused attention from professors at this pivotal point in their academic progression.</p>
                    <p><strong>The World Away</strong><br>Then, students leave the Troy campus for a semester during the traditional junior yearâ€”either fall or springâ€”to pursue their passions in the form of co-ops, internships, civic engagement, research, or international experiences. Students who pursue these opportunities during their academic career are better prepared for future professional careers and graduate school.</p>
