            <h2>M.S. in Information Technology and Web Science</h2>
            <h3>Solve problems in a data- and information-intensive world</h3>
            <p>The Rensselaer M.S. in Information Technology balances the study of management strategies and technology
                leadership with advanced course work in an IT concentration. Students complete a suite of core and
                capstone courses and also select three to five additional courses to complete their concentrations.
                Professional and research tracks are offered for the M.S. in IT degree.</p>

            <p>Learn more about our featured graduate students: <a href="https://science.rpi.edu/itws/grads">here</a>
            </p>

            <h4>Plan of Study</h4>
            <p>All students develop a Plan of Study with their IT Advisor which includes a minimum of 10 courses (30
                credits), a minimum of six courses (eighteen credits or more) at the 6000 graduate level, and no more
                than 5 courses from the Lally School of Management and Technology (prefix MGMT).</p>

            <h3>PROFESSIONAL TRACK</h3>
            <h4>Capstone Course</h4>
            <p>The M.S. in IT Capstone course integrates the knowledge and professional practice of IT core and focus
                track courses. Topics in database systems, networking, data analytics, software design and engineering,
                management of technology, human-computer interaction, and ethics are applied within a framework of
                global e-business strategy. The course utilizes an Information Technology Team Project with a real
                organization to practice the major concepts of the IT Degree. Team members select, develop, and present
                a significant technology implementation project, incorporating strategy, systems development, and
                business planning.</p>
